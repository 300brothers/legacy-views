This repository contains a legacy version of Saleor with its former Storefront 1.0 and Dashboard 1.0 (Django views and HTML templates).

NOTE: We do not currently maintain the legacy version â€” we provide limited support only as resources are concentrated on the current version. If you would like to maintain the legacy version please open a pull request, we would be happy to review it.

Development of Saleor 2.0+ continues, including the new storefront and dashboard. You can check out the roadmap of how we are achieving here [https://saleor.io/open-source/#roadmap]; a service-based headless approach to utilise best-in-class APIs of the future. Innovate through integrations such as multi-currency, multi-channel and many more. 

 *New updates and improvements will not be available on the legacy version.*

You can find the latest version of Saleor, storefront and dashboard in their individual repositories:

- https://github.com/mirumee/saleor
- https://github.com/mirumee/saleor-dashboard
- https://github.com/mirumee/saleor-storefront


If you have any questions or feedback, do not hesitate to contact us via Spectrum or Gitter.
